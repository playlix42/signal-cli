### Quick Start

* For using the module, you have to create a client object first: `signal_cli.Client(<address>, <port>, <phone_number>)`, with `address` and `port` building the access point to the signal-cli-rest-api and `number` building the phone number which should be used as client number.
* After creating the client object, you can use the other methods in their respective classes by passing the client object to the class object the method is in
